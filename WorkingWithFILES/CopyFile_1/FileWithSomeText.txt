A poem in English

I want to write a poem in English
But I don't know where to start
Should I rhyme or use free verse
Should I be witty or smart

I want to write a poem in English
But I don't know what to say
Should I write about love or nature
Should I be serious or gay

I want to write a poem in English
But I don't know how to end
Should I make a point or leave it open
Should I be a friend or offend

I want to write a poem in English
But I don't know if it's good
Should I share it with the world or keep it
Should I be proud or misunderstood
